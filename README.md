## Overview
Welcome to the Railway Administration System! This project is a meticulously designed railway management system crafted using Python, Streamlit, and SQLite. It aims to streamline various aspects of railway operations efficiently through an intuitive user interface.

## Key Functionalities
- **Train Management:**
    - **Seamless Addition:** Easily add new trains, specifying details like train number, name, departure date, and destinations.
    - **Comprehensive Overview:** View all existing trains and their details at a glance.
    - **Efficient Search:** Find trains quickly by train number or starting/ending destinations.
    - **Simple Removal:** Remove trains from the system effortlessly when required.
- **Ticket Booking:**
    - **User-Friendly Booking:** Passengers can book tickets by selecting seat types (window, aisle, middle) and providing essential personal details.
    - **Cancellation Ease:** Cancel booked tickets without hassle as needed.
- **Seat Availability:**
    - **Real-Time Updates:** Check current seat availability and passenger details for any specific train conveniently.
